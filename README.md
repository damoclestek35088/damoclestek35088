  <strong>Hi, I'm Damocles!</strong>
</h1>


My name is Damocles. Despite me having a github profile, I hardly know how to code. I'm currently learning to code, and it's going fine. If you're professional, please reach out! Any help would be appreciated!! I had a previous account; I kept getting stalked, so I had to create an alt.
